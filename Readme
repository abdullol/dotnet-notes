** Sealed 
** Abstract
- An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
- An abstract class may contain abstract methods and accessors.
- It is not possible to modify an abstract class with the sealed modifier because the two modifiers have opposite meanings. The sealed modifier prevents a class from
being inherited and the abstract modifier requires a class to be inherited.
- A non-abstract class derived from an abstract class must include actual implementations of all inherited abstract methods and accessors.

** Abstract Method
- An abstract method is implicitly a virtual method.
- Abstract method declarations are only permitted in abstract classes.
Because an abstract method declaration provides no actual implementation, there is no method body; the method declaration simply ends with a semicolon and there are no curly braces ({ }) following the signature. 
For example:
public abstract void MyMethod();  
- The implementation is provided by a method override, which is a member of a non-abstract class.
- It is an error to use the static or virtual modifiers in an abstract method declaration.
- It is an error to use the abstract modifier on a static property.
